🧩 Git Workflow Summary

Initialized repo using git init

Created two branches:

feature/calm-heading

feature/energize-heading

Both branches edited the same line in index.html → intentional merge conflict

Resolved conflict manually by editing the file and committing the fix

Pushed final merged version to GitHub
